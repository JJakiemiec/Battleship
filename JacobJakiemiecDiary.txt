2/4/21
initial meeting with Kelby (1hr)

The first thing we did was discuss user stories. For the core design, we decided on
making classes for the game, player, board, and ship. Where the game has two players,
the player has two boards, and a board has 5 ships. The only other bit feature that
we decided to do, besides local multiplayer, was to have an AI with multiple difficulty
levels. However, we both decided that the core gameplay must be finished before
we can do any other features.

After the user stories, we started coding. But mostly it was me trying to figure out
how to properly get git integrated into visual studio, and also remembering how header
and source files work with object oriented programming. But once those were figured out,
we started working on the beggining of the ship class.
