initial meeting with Kelby (1hr) pair

The first thing we did was discuss user stories. For the core design, we decided on
making classes for the game, player, board, and ship. Where the game has two players,
the player has two boards, and a board has 5 ships. The only other bit feature that
we decided to do, besides local multiplayer, was to have an AI with multiple difficulty
levels. However, we both decided that the core gameplay must be finished before
we can do any other features.

After the user stories, we started coding. But mostly it was me trying to figure out
how to properly get git integrated into visual studio, and also remembering how header
and source files work with object oriented programming. But once those were figured out,
we started working on the beggining of the ship class.

working on ship / board (3hr) pair

For the most part, everthing went well. We spent most of the time trying to figure out how
we were going to store the data and how the classes would interact with each other. We settled
on having the board would hold spaces that knew if they were hit or not, and what ship (or no ship)
were on its tile. The ship would hold where each space is and if its been hit, if it has been 
destroyed, and its type of ship / size.

fiddling around (1 hr)

I decided to work on specifically the ship class for a little bit, mostly just to see if we 
could solidify some of the more abstract parts of the class. I also got the ship to know where each
space is (hopefully).

working on board

I worked towards making board printable so that testing is easier. Primarilly, I worked on a member
function that outputs the board as a 2D vector of characters. While working on it, I noticed that
we needed more data within the board class, so I made a new member variable called boardtype, which
keeps track of what kind of board the object is. This was made just to differentiate between the
board that the player uses to place their ships / keep track of opponent's guesses vs the board that
the player uses to keep track of their own guesses.
