    Discussed User Stories (and difficulties)
    Initial Design Requirements
        Game Class
            Manages Players, plays Battleship, manages rules
        Player Class
            Contains Both Player's boards
        Board Class
            Contains a grid and ships on grid
        Ship Class
            Contains ship size and health remaining
    Focus on the core game FIRST -> text based
        If extra time add AI enemies (easy, medium, hard) & | GUI
    Class Management / Heiarchy:
        Game >> Player >> Board >> Ship
